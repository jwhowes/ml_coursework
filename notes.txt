DATA: () means not sure if relevant. An indent below a note means that info is stored in another table
Module:
	- ID
	- length
	- (start date)

Assessments:
	- module ID
	- presentation ID (not sure what presentation means)
	- type
	- date

Students:
	- gender
	- age range
	- number of previous attempts
	- region
	- disability
	- final result [THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GUESS]
	- The modules the student is taking
		- student ID
		- module ID
		- presentation ID
		- date's of registration and unregistration
	- Past assessments (very much doubt the model will have access to this)
		- student ID
		- assessment ID
		- date submitted
		- score

VLE info (external resources available to students):
	- site ID
	- module ID
	- assessment ID
	- some other stuff
	- each student's uses
		- date of student's interaction
		- the number of times a student interacted with it that day

GENERAL NOTES:
	The goal is clearly to take a student's information and guess their final result.
	Not sure how much information this model will be given (do they just get student information or do they get some degree of past academic achievements?)
	Think about representation for non-numerical values.

IDEAS:
	I could try just taking a student's information on its own (no extra info from courses etc.). This would be very easy but probably won't get very good results.
	I could try using stratified-sampling (with what field?)
		- Probably one of the aggregate ones, check some correlation stuff
	Think about feature scaling

Data I'll use:
	- Non-aggregate:
		- studentInfo (All fields)
	- Aggregate:
		- studentRegistration (number of courses)
		- studentAssessment (average score)

final_result is not an integer so doesn't show up in the correlation matrix:
	- Solutions:
		- Make it an integer
			- Via one-hot encoding
			- Maybe just make distinction = 2, pass = 1, fail/withdrawn = 0
